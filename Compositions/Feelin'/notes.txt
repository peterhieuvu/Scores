Consider moving the first verse forward since it's a bit more of a chorus or verse than it is an intro

You see I'm, walkin' along

As we go further into this track I'm getting more used to hearing the prechorus thingy right after the intro
and so I need to accomplish this like tomorrow or else I risk being too late and it'll sound normal to me when it 
may not be ideal. This is important.
